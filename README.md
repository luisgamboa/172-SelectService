# 172-SelectService

From here on in the Assignments will use the ShowTracker database. We will also use ADO Data Entities rather than classic AD0.

In this assignment we will create a new service that returns various data from the database. In particular it should
list of all venues (just the names of the venues)
A list of all artists (just the names)
list of all shows (just the names)
list of all shows for a particular venue (for this list the show name, show date,  show start time)
list of all shows for a particular artist (Show name, show date, show time and venue Name)
Additionally Create tests for each of the methods and test whether they succeed or fail.
